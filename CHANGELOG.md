# Changelog

## Unreleased (fix/esp-idf-ci-failures) - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- Isolate `esp_wifi` requirement in `main/CMakeLists.txt` to only `wifi` and `display` transport components, ensuring the `eth` transport compiles without wifi dependencies.
- Add `cppcheck` suppressions in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for third-party QR code files (`qrcode.c` and `qrcode.h`).
- Support compiling under ESP-IDF v6.0+ locally by adding version-conditional CMake target dependencies for the split GPIO and SPI drivers, and adding conditional registry dependency for W5500 Ethernet driver (`espressif/w5500`).
- Resolve application binary partition overflow on local debug configuration by changing the default partition table setting to `CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_SINGLE_APP_LARGE=y` (1.5MB).


## Unreleased (fix/cppcheck-warnings) - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- Resolve cppcheck static analysis warnings and style issues:
  - Initialize `bytesReceived` in `src/Helpers/UdpServer.cpp` to avoid potential use of an uninitialized variable.
  - Add `main/host_compat.h` to provide guarded host-side `MACSTR` / `MAC2STR` macros so host builds and static analysis can process Wi‑Fi event logging without defining ESP-IDF headers.
  - Replace C-style cast with `reinterpret_cast` for `sockaddr` in `main/wifi/DnsServer.cpp` to satisfy cppcheck style checks.

Commit: https://github.com/GlomarGadaffi/pocket-dial/commit/825354bf88afd1fcd965c7ab743999ce10b9e919

### Notes
- `host_compat.h` only defines macros when they are not already defined, so ESP-IDF builds remain unaffected.
- This change targets CI cleanliness and static analysis; runtime behavior on ESP32 devices is unchanged.
